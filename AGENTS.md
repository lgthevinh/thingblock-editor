# Agent Guide: scratch-editor

## AI-assisted development policy

See [CONTRIBUTING.AI.md](https://github.com/scratchfoundation/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.AI.md) for Scratch's
org-wide policy on AI-assisted contributions. The short version: human developers remain responsible for all code
they submit. Do not submit code you cannot explain and defend in a review.

## Agent defaults

Use these defaults unless the user asks otherwise:

1. Keep changes minimal and scoped to the user request. Do not refactor surrounding code, add features, or clean up
   style in areas you weren't asked to touch.
2. Do not preserve backward compatibility when it isn't required. When all callers are internal to a package,
   rename or restructure freely. All packages in this repo are published to npm and consumed externally, so treat
   each package's public exports as a contract and preserve compatibility unless explicitly told otherwise.
3. Write comments that explain the current code, not its history. Do not reference prior implementations,
   intermediate states, or what the code "used to do." If an approach seems counterintuitive, explain why it is
   correct now — not why it changed.
4. Prefer fixing root causes over adding surface-level workarounds or assertions.
5. When fixing a bug, start by adding one or more failing tests that reproduce it, then implement the fix. Iterate
   until all tests pass, including but not limited to the new tests. Use the test framework already in use in that
   package — see "Packages at a glance" below.
6. When adding runtime guards for states that should never happen, log actionable context (function name, relevant
   IDs, key flags) rather than failing silently. Use `console.warn` for recoverable states and `console.error` for
   invalid required data.
7. Preserve failure semantics when refactoring. An implicit crash (null dereference, `!` assertion) should become
   an explicit `throw` with a useful message — not silent failure. Code that previously wouldn't crash still
   shouldn't, but consider whether a warning is warranted. Replacing a potential null dereference with
   `if (!foo) return` could make a bug harder to find; `if (!foo) throw new Error(...)` surfaces it.
8. Do not add error handling, fallbacks, or validation for scenarios that cannot happen. Trust internal code and
   framework guarantees. Only validate at system boundaries (user input, external APIs).

## What this repository is

`scratch-editor` is an npm workspaces monorepo that extends the Scratch visual programming environment into a
drag-and-drop firmware development IDE for Arduino-compatible hardware. Users program physical devices —
motors, sensors, servos, LEDs — using Scratch blocks, with the extension architecture designed to support any
Arduino-compatible device without changes to the core editor.

The longer-term directions include educational hardware programming (making physical computing accessible to
beginners through Scratch's block metaphor) and a general-purpose hardware extension platform reusable for
future device integrations.

All packages are published to npm under the `@scratch/` scope. They are consumed both internally (e.g.,
`scratch-www` loads `scratch-gui`) and by third parties.

## Build and lint

Run workspace-wide commands from the repo root:

```sh
npm run build    # Build all packages (production)
npm test         # Test all packages
npm run clean    # Clean all packages
```

Run per-package commands from the package directory, or from the root with `--workspace`:

```sh
cd packages/scratch-vm && npm test
# or equivalently:
npm test --workspace=packages/scratch-vm
```

Each package defines its own `test` and `build` scripts; see "Packages at a glance" for specifics.

**Commit messages are enforced.** Husky + commitlint validate every commit against the
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format. A commit that doesn't conform will be
rejected by the pre-commit hook.

## Packages at a glance

| Package | Language | Bundler | Tests |
| - | - | - | - |
| `scratch-gui` | JavaScript / JSX (some TypeScript) | webpack | Jest |
| `scratch-vm` | JavaScript | webpack | Tap |
| `scratch-blocks` | TypeScript | webpack | Vitest |
| `scratch-render` | JavaScript | webpack | Tap |
| `scratch-storage` | JavaScript | webpack | Jest |
| `scratch-svg-renderer` | JavaScript | webpack | Tap |
| `task-herder` | TypeScript | Vite | Vitest |
| `scratch-media-lib-scripts` | JavaScript | — | Jest |

`task-herder` represents the target stack for new packages (TypeScript + Vite + Vitest). `scratch-blocks` uses
the same test framework (Vitest) but retains webpack as its bundler. The remaining packages reflect the legacy
stack and are being migrated incrementally.

## Technology conventions by package

**For existing packages**: follow the conventions already in use in that package — language, bundler, test
framework, and style. Do not introduce TypeScript into a JavaScript package, or Vitest into a Jest package,
unless that migration is the explicit goal of the task.

**For new packages**: follow the org defaults — TypeScript, Vite, Vitest, `eslint-config-scratch`.

All packages use ESLint 9 flat config (`eslint.config.mjs`) with `eslint-config-scratch`. If a package also uses
Prettier (currently `task-herder`), run `npm run format` in addition to lint.

### scratch-gui specifics

- React functional components with hooks for new code; class components exist in older code.
- Keep components presentational where possible; connect to Redux only in container files.
- Use `react-intl` / `FormattedMessage` for all user-visible strings. Do not hardcode English in JSX.
- After adding or changing messages, run `npm run i18n:src` to update the translation source file.
- Integration tests (`test/integration/`) require a browser environment via Jest + jsdom; they are slow and
  should not be run unnecessarily. Smoke tests (`test/smoke/`) require a live server.
- **Sprite UI is removed.** The right panel (formerly stage + sprite selector) is now a firmware device panel
  (`components/gui/device-panel`) containing `CodeView` (generated code display) and `SerialLog` (Monitor,
  collapsible serial/input panel). The VM's sprite/target execution model is kept intact — one implicit device
  target — but no sprite UI renders.

### scratch-blocks specifics

- Block definitions live in `src/blocks/`. Each file registers blocks via `Blockly.Blocks.<block_id> = { init() }`.
- `src/index.ts` imports all block files and exports the configured Blockly instance.
- Uses TypeScript throughout; follow the existing patterns when adding or removing block definitions.

### scratch-vm specifics

- Extension entry points live in `src/extensions/`. Each extension exports a class with `getInfo()` and block
  implementation methods.
- Firmware device manifests live in `src/extensions/devices/`. Board-selection icons belong in each device's
  `assets/icon.svg` and are exposed through `vm.getDeviceList()` as `iconURL`; do not add GUI-side icon maps for
  VM devices.
- i18n strings in extensions are extracted with `format-message`. Run `npm run i18n:src` after changing them.

## npm workflow

Use `npm ci` from the repo root to install all workspace dependencies from `package-lock.json`.

When adding or updating a dependency in a specific package:

```sh
npm install some-package@version --workspace=packages/scratch-vm
```

This updates both `package.json` in the target package and the root `package-lock.json`.

Keep each section of a package's `package.json` (`dependencies`, `devDependencies`, `scripts`) in alphabetical
order. The same applies to the root `package.json`.

**Do not publish packages manually.** Every package has a `prepublishOnly` script that will error if you try.
Publishing is handled exclusively by the CI release pipeline.

## Before submitting changes

Review all changes and confirm:

- **Scope**: Changes are confined to the user request; nothing extra was added or modified.
- **Correctness**: Logic is sound and edge cases were considered.
- **Comments**: Comments are necessary, short, and clear; self-explanatory code has none.
- **Simplicity**: Implementation is as simple as possible; no speculative abstractions remain.
- **Documentation**: Update `AGENTS.md` and any other documentation files whose content is affected by the change
  (commands, repo structure, conventions, etc.). The "Packages at a glance" table is particularly prone to going
  stale when a package migrates its tooling.
- **Commit format**: Commit message follows Conventional Commits — the husky hook will reject it otherwise.
- **Build passes**: `npm run build` (or `npm run build` in the affected package) completes successfully.
- **Tests pass**: `npm test` (or `npm test` in the affected package) completes with no failures.
- **No lint errors**: `npm run test:lint` (or `npm run lint`) passes in the affected package.
